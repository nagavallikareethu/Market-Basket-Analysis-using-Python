# Market Basket Analysis with Python

This repository showcases a comprehensive Market Basket Analysis project using Python, designed to uncover patterns and relationships within transactional datasets. Market Basket Analysis is a powerful tool for retail and e-commerce businesses to optimize product placement, boost cross-selling opportunities, and enhance marketing strategies.

## 📚 Overview

Market Basket Analysis involves identifying which products are frequently purchased together. This analysis helps businesses improve their revenue, customer satisfaction, and overall operations by leveraging insights from transactional data.

## 🔍 Steps Performed

The analysis was conducted using the following process:

1. **Data Collection:** Transactional data including purchase history, shopping carts, and invoices.
2. **Data Exploration:** Checking for missing values and generating summary statistics.
3. **Visualization:** 
   - Item distribution.
   - Top 10 most popular items.
   - Customer behavior, including average quantity and total spending.
4. **Association Rule Mining:** 
   - Used the **Apriori algorithm** to identify frequent itemsets.
   - Generated association rules to uncover actionable insights.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:** 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `plotly` for interactive visualizations.
  - `mlxtend` for association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm.

## 📊 Key Results

- Identified the most popular items sold in the store (e.g., bananas).
- Analyzed customer behavior to understand purchasing trends.
- Derived actionable insights using association rules with metrics such as support, confidence, and lift.

## 🔗 Features

- Visualized sales distribution and customer behavior with interactive plots.
- Generated association rules to reveal product relationships, aiding in strategic decision-making.
